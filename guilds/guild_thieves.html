            <h3>Positive Trait: Resourcefulness</h3>
            <p>Members are incredibly resourceful, able to navigate challenging situations and solve problems creatively. They often have a strong network and can acquire hard-to-find items or information.</p>
            <p><strong>Impact on Rolls:</strong> Members can gain advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) and Charisma (Deception) checks, as they’re skilled at manipulating situations to their advantage.</p>
            <p><strong>Roleplay Opportunities:</strong> They can leverage their connections for information and resources, allowing them to navigate social situations more effectively.</p>

        <div class="trait">
            <h3>Negative Trait: Distrust and Betrayal</h3>
            <p>The guild’s emphasis on stealth and secrecy breeds a culture of mistrust, even among its members. Betrayal is common, as loyalty can shift based on personal gain, leading to a reputation for treachery.</p>
            <p><strong>Impact on Rolls:</strong> Characters might face disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks when trying to gain the trust of others, as their guild's reputation for treachery may precede them.</p>
            <p><strong>Roleplay Opportunities:</strong> They may encounter NPCs who are wary or hostile, leading to tense interactions and the need for clever roleplay to overcome distrust.</p>
