            <h3>Negative Trait: Stubborn Traditionalists</h3>
            <p>Many guild members cling to old ways and methods, making them resistant to change or new innovations. This can sometimes prevent them from adapting to new demands or styles in their crafts, leading to conflicts with younger artisans.</p>
            <p><span class="system-name">Impact on Rolls:</span> Members may suffer disadvantage on Intelligence (Investigation) checks when working with unfamiliar or innovative materials, as their approach is rooted in tradition and habit.</p>

                <ul>
                   <li><span class="guild-name">Merchants' Guild:</span> Merchants frequently hire assassins to take out competition or silence troublesome individuals. Assassins enjoy a steady stream of contracts, and merchants wield power through fear.</li>
                   <li><span class="guild-name">Thieves' Guild:</span> The Assassins’ Guild often relies on the thieves for surveillance or to obtain intel before a kill. The two guilds respect each other's craft and sometimes work in tandem on complex, multi-layered operations.</li>

                <p><strong>Rivals:</strong></p>

                    <li><span class="guild-name">Healers' Guild:</span> Healers despise assassins for creating death and suffering, while assassins find healers meddlesome, especially if they revive targets or interfere with contracts. There may even be secret vendettas between them.</li>
                    <li><span class="guild-name">Mages' Guild:</span> Assassins fear and respect mages for their power, but also see them as a threat. Mages who delve into necromancy or soul-binding could create lingering enemies among the Assassins' Guild by enslaving spirits or thwarting their "finality of death" code.</li>
