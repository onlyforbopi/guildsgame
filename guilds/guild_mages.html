                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Thieves's Guild:</strong> Mages often require rare or illegal magical components, and the thieves can procure these without drawing attention. In return, the mages might supply the thieves with enchanted tools or scrolls that make their jobs easier.</li>
                    <li><strong>Merchants's Guild:</strong> There is a strained but practical alliance. Merchants trade in valuable enchanted items, and the mages profit from controlling that supply. However, this relationship is fragile and can easily devolve into sabotage if one side grows too powerful..</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Rivals:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Assassins's Guild:</strong> Mages and assassins may clash over control of the city’s more dangerous elements. Assassins might resent mages for using scrying magic to track down contracts or meddle in their affairs, making them natural rivals.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fighters's Guild:</strong> Mages view fighters as brutes who interfere with their delicate arcane plans, while fighters see mages as elitist manipulators who rely on tricks instead of strength. This mutual disdain can often lead to conflict.</li>
